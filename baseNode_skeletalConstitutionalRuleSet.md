# First some thoughts

1. constitutional (meta-meta)(how to change the rule-rules)
	2. collective choice (meta)(how to change the rules)
		3. operational (object)(the rules)
		
1. who is a member, how do members coordinate
	2. what members coordinate to do
		3. what members have coordinated to do
		
1. change using defined process (difficult)
	2. change using process defined in 1. (easy)
		3. 
		
... perhaps three levels is too many?

1. who is a member, what are they a member of, how do they coordinate
	2. what they coordinate to do
	
1. change using process defined in 1. (difficult)
	2. change using process defined in 1. (easier)
	
1. 'collective decision made with 2/3 majority'
	2. (70 % in favor of cleaning rota) â†’ 'rota system of different areas, allocation by lot, amendments by 1/2 majority'
		(3. << a specific rota instance >>)
