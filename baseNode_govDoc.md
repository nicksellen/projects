# govDoc 
_baseNode → govDoc_

## Description
To create a document which outlines a minimal set of procedures for governing a house (or other living space) as a common resource. Should be short, simple and clear.

## Features
* Defines the domain to which it applies.
* Includes (space for) purposes, objectives and principles (i.e. why associate, what for and how.)
* Includes relevant conceptual assertions (i.e. unrestricted domain, negative rights, etc.)
* Not related to or dependent on external enforcement.
* Provision for tiers of rules with different energy barriers to change.
* Functional as an agreement. (i.e. it is possible for people to 'sign'.)

### Questions
* How does the 'three powers' governance model relate to a housing node?
	* I.e. Legislative, executive and judicial functions
* How do Ostrom's CPR design principles relate to a housing node? 
	* I.e. Clear boundaries, congruence to locality, collective-choice, monitoring, graduated sanctions, conflict-resolution, and minimal rights.
* Why bother to make it harder to change some rules than others?
	* _"2. Changes in deeper-level rules usually are more difficult and more costly to accomplish, thus increasing the stability of mutual expectation amond individuals interacting according to a set of rules... Rules provide stability of expectations, and efforts to change rules can rapidly reduce that stability."_ - Elinor Ostrom, Governing the Commons, pg 53-54.
* How to decide which tier to put a rule in?
* Separate 1°, 2° and 3° in different docs, or within same doc?
* What should be off the record completely?
* How to develop policies without perverse incentives?
	* Black-hat thinking

1. **Purposes**
	1. To produce, develop and/or distribute goods and services that are free for use, transformation and redistribution.
	2. To provide an environment to holistically support those within the collective to live, work and play.
	3. To support others in establishing spaces which are governed in common.

2. **Axioms**
	1. The following statements reflect the reason for association and the intention of governance and as such should be considered during interpretation. These axioms are: of the  itself. represent why the association exists and how the association e reflect both the 'end' and 'means'  intended to provide an undestanding of why the association exists and how it should 
		1. that individuals are autonomous to pursue their interests, and
		2. that the interests of individuals are treated equally, and
		3. that opposition of interests is avoided in preference to the pursuit of support.
	2. Unrestricted domain and negativity... The collective retains has an unrestricted domain to legislate, execute and enforce

3. **Conflict**
	1. When an action (or inaction) meets opposition. The actor could be an individual, sub-group or the collective. We do not have specialized monitors or enforcers and thus conflict is ultimately detected by individuals and resolved by individuals or the collective.
	1. Between actor and individual. change perspective or action
	2. Between actor and informal norm.	change norm or action
	3. Between actor and formal agreementchange agreement or action
	
4. **Decision-making**
	1. By individuals, or else
	2. By unanimous acceptance, or else 
	3. By weighted score voting.
	4. Changes to this agreement
	
<p align="center"><i>Finance</i></p>
1. Regarding minimal recognition of rights to organise
	1. Debt against the association if unpaid introduces the probability of state-backed legal action against the association. Legal action against the association poses a direct threat to the fulfillment of its aims. Therefore (unpayable) debt must be avoided as far as possible.
	2. All loans taken out in the name of the association must be decided by special procedure.
	3. Regular, obligatory costs should be projected one year in advance and have finance reserved for their payment. This includes:
		1. Grundsteur (ground tax)
		2. Rundfunkbeitrag (license fees )
		3. Haftpflicht, eventuell Wohngebäudeversicherung (house insurance)
		
2. Regarding minimal provision of common goods

Individual

* Announce-it: notify others (i.e. 'I plan to do x after yyyy-mm-dd')
* Ask-for-advice: consult affected, interested or knowledgable parties for advice (not authorization.)

Collective. 
* Recommended for actions that irreversibly alter commonly used resources or require the labor of multiple individuals to achieve. Required for actions that have met or would meet resistance.
1. Unanimity
	1.1 Unanimous support: all individuals actively support decision.
	1.2 Unanimous acceptance: no individual actively resists decision.
2. Weighted score voting
	2.1 Light procedure
	2.2 Medium procedure
	2.3 Heavy procedure

* ↑ room size (area & volume)
* ↑ proximity to food preparation area
* ↑ proximity to building entrance
* ↑ access points (doors and passageways)
	
(where “space” = a volume enclosed by walls, ceiling, floor, windows and door frames.)
