# Collective Choices

### Visitor(/guest/) <!-- May be better to entirely shift Visitor to operational level... -->
1. A person initially or temporarily engages with the space as a visitor.
1. There are no criteria for a person to become a visitor.
1. A person becomes a visitor by entering the space.
1. A person ceases to be a visitor by leaving the space.
1. A visitor may reside in the space for up to 7 days in total after which point they should (1) apply for a further 7-day extension, (2) become a Volunteer or (3) leave the space.
1. Applications for extension are processed according to the Application procedure where `the participants` are residential volunteers and members, and `the grace period` is 7 days.

### Operational Activity
1. Individual Action
	1. Any individual may take action by themself provided:
		1. they are unaware of any opposition towards the action and
		1. they are willing and able to personally reverse the action if required.
	1. There is no specific format for individual action. Whilst in may cases it may be appropriate to simply [start](https://blog.holacracy.org/individual-action-in-holacracy-6672a347238e), in other cases it may be appropriate to [ask for advice](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making) or [announce a planned action](https://medium.com/embassy-network/an-evolving-doocracy-3a6123f9b170) before starting.
	1. If an individual has opposition towards a current or planned individual action they should voice it early, clearly and kindly to the actor.
	1. If a current or planned individual action meets opposition the actor should pause or postpone it and proceed with unanimous acceptance.
	
1. Unanimous Acceptance
	1. Unanimous Acceptance of a proposal is attained if no individual opposes it after being given a free, equal and unambiguous opportunity to do so.
	1. Finding a unanimously accepted proposal has no fixed format but could include any activity to increase understanding or creativity including rounds, talking objects, consensus facilitation, socratic dialogue, etc, etc.
	1. If a proposal with unanimous acceptance can not be found in a proportionate time-frame, a decision by score voting should be made. The switch from unanimous acceptance to score voting can be made by unanimous acceptance or simple majorty.

1. Score vote
	1. Exit: collchange selected.

### Application procedure
1. `The participants` must be provided with a method that allows them to vote ‘support’, ‘accept’ or ‘oppose' anonymously in the following votes. <!-- Anonymity is used to counteract [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) and [peer pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure) which can deter people from expressing their honest opinion. -->
1. `The participants` should first take a mock vote on whether the application should succeed before publicly discussing the application. <!-- A mock vote is used to encourage independent thought and counteract [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) during the subsequent discussion. -->
1. After the mock vote, the application may be publicly discussed and, in particular, any concerns should be raised and addressed.
1. After the discussion, `the participants` should take a binding vote on whether the application should succeed:
	1. if there are 3 or more times as many ‘support’ votes to ‘oppose’ votes, the application succeeds or
	1. else the application fails and the applicant should not reapply for `the grace period`.
