1. A person becomes a visitor by entering the space.
1. A person ceases to be a visitor by leaving the space.

### Application procedure
1. `The participants` must be provided with a method that allows them to vote ‘support’, ‘accept’ or ‘oppose' anonymously in the following votes. <!-- Anonymity is used to counteract [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) and [peer pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure) which can deter people from expressing their honest opinion. -->
1. `The participants` should first take a mock vote on whether the application should succeed before publicly discussing the application. <!-- A mock vote is used to encourage independent thought and counteract [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) during the subsequent discussion. -->
1. After the mock vote, the application may be publicly discussed and, in particular, any concerns should be raised and addressed.
1. After the discussion, `the participants` should take a binding vote on whether the application should succeed:
	1. if there are 3 or more times as many ‘support’ votes to ‘oppose’ votes, the application succeeds or
	1. else the application fails and the applicant should not reapply for `the grace period`.
