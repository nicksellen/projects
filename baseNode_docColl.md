# Collective choice

### Operational change
1. Individual action
	1. Any individual may take action by themself provided:
		1. they are unaware of any opposition towards the action and
		1. they are willing and able to personally reverse the action if required.
	1. There is no specific format for individual action. Whilst in may cases it may be appropriate to simply [start](https://blog.holacracy.org/individual-action-in-holacracy-6672a347238e), in other cases it may be appropriate to [ask for advice](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making) or [announce a planned action](https://medium.com/embassy-network/an-evolving-doocracy-3a6123f9b170) before starting.
	1. If an individual has opposition towards a current or planned individual action they should voice it early, clearly and kindly to the actor.
	1. If a current or planned individual action meets opposition the actor should pause or postpone it and proceed with unanimous acceptance.
	
1. Unanimous acceptance
	1. Unanimous acceptance of a proposal is attained if no individual opposes it after being given a free, equal and unambiguous opportunity to do so.
	1. Finding a unanimously accepted proposal has no fixed format but could include any activity to increase understanding or creativity including rounds, talking objects, consensus facilitation, socratic dialogue, etc, etc.
	1. If a proposal with unanimous acceptance can not be found in a proportionate time-frame, a decision by score voting should be made. The switch from unanimous acceptance to score voting can be made by unanimous acceptance or simple majorty.

1. Score vote
