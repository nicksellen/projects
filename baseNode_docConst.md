# The Constitution

## 1 Preamble <!-- LAST -->
`NAME` is an open-entry, common-space. It is governed in three, cascading layers: the Constitutional layer, the Collective-Choice layer and the Operational layer. 

The Constitutional layer contains the core agreements upon which the other layers are built. It is documented in the Constitution (this document) and outlines the roles people can adopt and how changes can be made at the different layers. Making changes at this layer takes the most time and energy and should thus occur at the slowest rate. 

The Collective-Choice layer contains more concrete and specific agreements than those at the Constitutional layer. It is documented in the [Collective-Choices](url.here) and could include things such as policies, schedules, facts or best-practices. Making changes at this layer takes a moderate amount of time and energy and should thus occur at a moderate rate.

The Operational layer describes everything else. It is not centrally documented and could include things such as sub-group agreements, informal agreements or norms. Making changes at this layer takes the least time and energy and should thus occur at the fastest rate.

## 2. Purposes <!-- LAST -->

<p align="center"><i>Procedures</i></p>

## 7. Application Procedure

1. Finally `the participants` should take a binding vote in the same fashion as the mock vote. This time—
	1. if there are 3 or more times as many ‘support’ votes to ‘oppose’ votes, the application succeeds, or
	1. else the application fails at that time.
	
## 8. Operational Activity
### 8a. Individual Action
1. Any individual may take action by themself provided—
	1. they are unaware of any opposition towards the action, and
	1. they are willing and able to personally reverse the action if required.
1. There is no specific format for individual action. Whilst in may cases it may be appropriate to simply [start](https://blog.holacracy.org/individual-action-in-holacracy-6672a347238e), in other cases it may be appropriate to [ask for advice](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making) or [announce a planned action](https://medium.com/embassy-network/an-evolving-doocracy-3a6123f9b170) before starting.
1. If an individual has opposition towards a current or planned individual action they should voice it early, clearly and kindly to the actor.
1. If a current or planned individual action meets opposition the actor should pause or postpone it and proceed with Unanimous Acceptance.
	
### 8b. Unanimous Acceptance
1. Unanimous Acceptance of a proposal is attained if no individual opposes it after being given a free, equal and unambiguous opportunity to do so.
1. There is no specific format for finding a proposal with Unanimous Acceptance. Many tool and techniques exist which may help, including: rounds, talking objects, consensus facilitation, socratic dialogue, etc, etc.
1. If a proposal with Unanimous Acceptance can not be found in a proportionate time-frame, a decision by score voting should be made. The switch from Unanimous Acceptance to Score Voting can itself be made by Unanimous Acceptance or simple majority.

### 8c. Score Vote
1. Individuals discuss initial proposal(s) and create new ones.
1. After discussion, create proposal list by gathering— 
	1. the initial proposal(s),
	1. any additional proposals,
	1. a 'status quo' control proposal (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing',) and 
	1. an 'escalate procedure' control proposal (i.e. 'switch procedure to Collective Choice'.)	
 1. Individuals score the listed proposals from a range of +1 (indicating total support) to -1 (indicating total opposition.)
 	1. count -1 as -3,
	1. total the adjusted scores for each proposal,
	1. the proposal with the highest total is selected as the final decision.

## 9. Collective Choice
1. Collective Choice refers to the procedure by which any addition, subtraction or other change to the Collection is made.
1. The procedure is initiated when all in-space Members and Volunteers have been notified of a clear and explicit proposal which is not contrary to any other Collective Choice made within the last 7 days.
1. The primary phase of the procedure, lasts 3 days during which Members should consider the initial proposal and may create alternative proposals. 
1. At the end of the primary phase a list of proposals is created by gathering—
	1. the initial proposal,
	1. any additional proposals,
	1. a 'status quo' control proposal (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing',) and 
	1. a 'repeat procedure' control proposal (i.e. 'perform the first and second phase again'.)
1. The secondary phase of the procedure lasts 3 days during which Members should individually score the listed proposals from a range of +3 (indicating total support) to -3 (indicating total opposition.) For a score to be valid it must identify the scorer. 
1. At the end of the secondary phase—
	1. the scores are simultaneously made public,
	1. negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 (e.g. a score of -2 becomes -6,)
	1. the adjusted scores for each proposal are totalled,
	1. the proposal with the highest total is selected as the final decision, and 
	1. the Collective Choices should be changes to reflect this decision (if applicable.)

## 10. Constitutional Amendment
1. Constitutional Amendment refers to the procedure by which any addition, subtraction or other change to the Constitution must be made.
1. The procedure is initiated when all Members, both resident and remote, are notified of a clear and explicit proposal which—
	1. has the support of at least 3 Members, and
	1. is not contrary to any other Constitutional Amendment made within the last 28 days.
1. The primary phase of the procedure lasts 7 days during which Members should consider the initial proposal and may create alternative proposals. 
1. At the end of the primary phase a list of proposals is created by gathering—
	1. the initial proposal, 
	1. any additional proposals, and 
	1. a 'status quo' control proposal (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing'.)
1. The secondary phase of the procedure lasts 7 days during which Members should individually score the listed proposals from a range of +3 (indicating total support) to -3 (indicating total opposition.) For a score to be valid it must identify the scorer. 
1. At the end of the secondary phase—
	1. the scores are simultaneously made public, 
	1. negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 (e.g. a score of -2 becomes -6,)
	1. the scores for each proposal are totalled,  
	1. the proposal with the highest total is selected, and
	1. if the selected proposal was also selected at the previous secondary phase—
		1. the proposal becomes the final decision, 
		1. the Constitution should be amended to reflect this decision, and
		1. the procedure of Constitutional Amendment is terminated. Or 
	1. else—
		1. the procedure is repeated (i.e. a further primary then secondary phase.)

## 11. Conflict Resolution
### 11a. Direct
1. Individuals are generally encouraged to resolve their conflicts directly.
1. There is no specific format for directly resolving conflicts. Many techniques and tools exist to prevent potential conflicts, manage ongoing conflicts and analyze resolved conflicts, including: the [Advice Process](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making), [Non-violent Communication](http://baynvc.org/key-assumptions-and-intentions-of-nvc/), [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/), [Sharing Circles](url), [1-on-1 dialogue](url), [Listen Looping, I-messages and Non-defensive Assertions.](https://loomio.coop/conflict_resolution_resources.html)

### 11b. Voluntary Assistance
1. If reasonable measures to resolve a conflict directly prove unsuccessful, individuals may voluntarily seek and/or accept assistance from third-parties.
1. There is no specific format for assisted conflict resolution. On the basis that all involved consent to participate, any number of scenarios are possible, including—
	1. a third-party person supporting a single person in the conflict ('support person',)
	1. a third-party person supporting multiple people in the conflict ('direct bridge',)
	1. third-party support people engague in dialogue on behalf of the people in conflict ('indirect bridge',) or
	1. the people in conflict meet before a third-party group to simply witness or offer advice ('panel'.)

### 11c. Intervention
1. If reasonable measures to resolve a conflict with voluntary assistance prove unsuccessful, the resident Volunteers and Members may intervene as a last esort.
1. Using the Score Voting procedure outlined in Operational Activity, where proposals may include—
	1. requesting an individual to participate in assisted conflict resolution,
	1. revoking an individuals' position of Volunteer or Member, or
	1. instructing an individual to leave the space temporarily or indefinitely.
