1. Operational action
	1. Operational action refers to activity not accounted for in the constitution or collective agreements.
	1. Operational action is taken by unanimous acceptance or, failing that, by score voting.
	1. Action is taken by unanimous acceptance if no individual actively opposes it. This can take many forms:
		1. Just-do-it: Simply go ahead. Go on, try it! (a.k.a. Doocracy)
		1. I-will-do-it: Announce that you plan to do something by HH-DD-MM-YYYY. Be sure to listen to any feedback you receive.
		1. Ask-for-advice: Ask each person that you think might be affected for their advice (not their authorization). You can also tell them about your great idea but first ask for - and listen to - whatever advice they might have. (a.k.a. Advice Process)
	1. All individuals.: All individuals are encouraged, in good faith, to take action with transparency, communication, and commensurate with reversibility unless met by opposition.
	1. Score voting. 

1. Collective choice
	1. Collective choice is initiated when all members and volunteers in the space have been notified of a proposal which has the backing of a member or volunteer.
	1. The process of constitutional change consists of a divergence phase followed by a decision phase.
		1. The divergence phase lasts for 3 days during which time individuals create other proposals. For a proposal to be valid it must be created or backed by at member or volunteer. At the end of this phase the valid proposals are gathered into a ballot along with the control proposal 'status quo', meaning 'keep things as they are/change nothing'.
		1. The decision phase lasts for 3 days during which time individuals score the proposals in the ballot. Only members may score proposals. Proposals are scored individually from a range of +3 to -3 and to be valid an individual must only score each proposal once and must identify themselves with their scores. At the end of this phase scores are simultaneously made public. Negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 (e.g. a scored of -2 is counted as -4.) Scores are totalled for each proposal and the proposal with the highest score is selected.
