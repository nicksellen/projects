# Constitution

## Preamble
nodeN is another node in the space network, a project to provide a physical platform for other projects and the people doing them, a bunch of people in some flats in East Germany.. people serve themselves, the project and the rest of the world. a set of **assets** dedicated to the fulfillment of certain **purposes**. The assets are governed by and for an association of people as a common-pool resources according to general **principles** and specific **roles** and **processes**.

The governance model has three layers: the constitutional layer, the collective layer and the operational layer. 

The constitutional layer describes the core agreements upon which the other layers are built. It is documented in the Constitution (this document.) It defines the roles that people can adopt and the processes by which changes at the different layers can be made amongst other things. Changes at this layer take the most time and energy and should thus occur at the lowest rate. 

The collective layer describes agreements which are more specific and fluid than those at the constitutional layer. It is documented in the [Collective-choices.](url.here) It could include things such as policies, schedules or best-practices (e.g. a cleaning rota.) Changes at this layer take a medium amount of time and energy and should thus occur at a medium rate.

The operational layer essentiually describes everything not described at the constitutional or collective layer. It is not centrally documented. It could include things such as sub-group agreements, informal agreements or norms (e.g. arranging a workshop.) Changes at this layer take the least time and energy and should thus occur at the  the fastest rate.

## Resources

		1. Just-do-it (a.k.a. Doocracy)
		1. I-will-do-it: Announce.
		1. Ask-for-advice: Ask each person that you think might be affected for their advice (not their authorization). (a.k.a. Advice Process)
	1. All individuals.: All individuals are encouraged, in good faith, to take action with transparency, communication, and commensurate with reversibility unless met by opposition.
	1. Score voting... tired

1. Collective change
	1. Collective change is initiated when all in-space members and volunteers have been notified of a collective proposal which has the backing of at least 1 member or volunteer.
	1. The process of constitutional change consists of a divergence phase followed by a decision phase.
	1. The divergence phase lasts for 3 days during which time individuals create other proposals. For a proposal to be valid it must be created or backed by at member or volunteer. At the end of this phase the initial proposal, other valid proposals and the control proposals 'status quo' (meaning 'keep things as they are/change nothing') and 'repeat process' (meaning 'do another divergence phase and decision phase') are gathered into a ballot.
	1. The decision phase lasts for 3 days during which time individuals score the proposals in the ballot. Only members and volunteers may score proposals. Proposals are privately scored from a range of +3 to -3 and to be valid an individual must only score each proposal once and must identify themselves with their scores. At the end of this phase scores are simultaneously made public. Negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 for counting purposes (e.g. a scored of -2 is counted as -4.) Scores are totalled for each proposal and the proposal with the highest score is selected.
	1. Collective changes should be given a grace period of 1 week during which no contrary changes are made or intitiated.

1. Constitutional change
	1. The process is initiated when all members have been notified of a constitutional proposal which has the backing of at least 3 members.
	1. The process ends when the same proposal is selected twice in a row.
	1. The process is a loop, the loop body is composed of a divergence phase followed by a decision phase.
		1. The divergence phase lasts for 7 days during which time individuals create other proposals. For a proposal to be valid it must be created or backed by at least one member. At the end of this phase the initial proposal, other valid proposals and the control proposal 'status quo' (meaning 'keep things as they are/change nothing') are gathered into a ballot.
		1. The decision phase lasts for 7 days during which time individuals score the proposals in the ballot. Only members may score proposals. Proposals are scored individually from a range of +3 to -3 and to be valid an individual must only score each proposal once and must identify themselves with their scores. At the end of this phase scores are simultaneously made public. Negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 for counting purposes (e.g. a scored of -2 is counted as -4.) Scores are totalled for each proposal and the proposal with the highest score is selected.
	1. Constitutional changes should be given a grace period of 1 calendar month during which no contrary changes are made or intitiated.

1. Conflict resolution
	1. Individuals are encouraged to resolve their conflicts directly if possible.
		1. Techniques and tools that may be helpful include Non-violent Communication, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and the Advice Process.
		1. An individual may seek assistance in the form of counselling or mediation. In this case the other conflicted party/ies need not participate in mediation.
	1. If direct attempts to resolve a conflict fails, the membership and volunteership may intervene to request the conflicted parties use some type of mediation.
	1. If mediation attempts also fail, the membership may intervene as a last resort to:
		1. Convert an individual(s) from volunteer to visitor and/or,
