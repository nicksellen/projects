# Constitution

## Preamble <!-- Come back to last -->
`NAME` is an open-entry common space governed as a commons. The governance model has three layers: the constitutional layer, the collective layer and the operational layer. 

The constitutional layer describes the core agreements upon which the other layers are built. It is documented in the Constitution (this document.) It defines the roles people can adopt and how changes can be made at the different layers. Changes at this layer take the most time and energy and should thus occur at the lowest rate. 

The collective layer describes agreements which are more specific and fluid than those at the constitutional layer. It is documented in the [Collective-choices.](url.here) It could include things such as policies, schedules, facts or best-practices. Changes at this layer take a medium amount of time and energy and should thus occur at a medium rate.

The operational layer describes everything else. It is not centrally documented. It could include things such as sub-group agreements, informal agreements or norms. Changes at this layer take the least time and energy and should thus occur at the fastest rate.

## Collective change
1. Collective change is initiated when all in-space members and volunteers have been notified of a collective proposal which has the backing of at least 1 member or volunteer.
1. The process of collective change (herein 'the process') consists of a divergence phase followed by a decision phase.
1. The divergence phase lasts for 3 days during which time individuals create other proposals. For a proposal to be valid it must be created or backed by at member or volunteer. At the end of this phase the initial proposal, other valid proposals and the control proposals 'status quo' (meaning 'keep things as they are/change nothing') and 'repeat process' (meaning 'do another divergence phase and decision phase') are gathered into a ballot.
1. The decision phase lasts for 3 days during which time individuals score the proposals in the ballot. Only members and volunteers may score proposals. Proposals are privately scored from a range of +3 to -3 and to be valid an individual must only score each proposal once and must identify themselves with their scores. At the end of this phase scores are simultaneously made public. Negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 for counting purposes (e.g. a scored of -2 is counted as -4.) Scores are totalled for each proposal and the proposal with the highest score is selected.
1. Collective changes should be7 given a grace period of 1 week during which no contrary changes are made or intitiated.

## Constitutional change
1. Constitutional change is fundamental activity that affects that to the governance are constitutional change refers is documented by the addition, subtraction or other transformation of the Constitution (this document.)
1. The process of constitutional change (herein 'the process') is a looped process.
1. The process is initiated when all members (resident and remote) have been informed of a constitutional proposal. A constitutional proposal (1) must be backed by at least 3 members and (2) should already be implemented at the collective layer.
1. The process is terminated when a proposal is selected twice in a row.
1. The process itself is composed of a divergence phase followed by a decision phase
	1. A divergence phase lasts 7 days during which people (1) should discuss the initial proposal and (2) may create alternative proposals. For an alternative proposal to be valid it must be created or backed by at least 1 member. At the end of a divergence phase a ballot is created by gathering (1) the initial proposal, (2) other valid proposals and (3) a 'status quo' control proposal (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing').
	1. A decision phase lasts 7 days during which each member may privately score each proposal once from a range of +3 to -3. For a score to be valid it must identify the scorer. At the end of a decision phase (1) the scores are simultaneously made public, (2) negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 (e.g. a score of -2 becomes -6,) (3) the valid scores for each proposal are totalled and (4) the proposal with the highest total is selected.
1. A constitutional change should be given a grace period of 1 calendar month during which no contrary changes are made or intitiated.

## Conflict resolution
1. Direct resolution
	1. Individuals are encouraged to acknowledge and resolve their conflicts directly.
