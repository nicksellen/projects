# The Constitution

## 1. Preamble
`NAME` is an open-entry, common-space. It is governed in three layers—
1. The Constitutional layer prescribes _who decides what should happen and how_. It includes the core agreements such as purposes, roles and procedures which support and supercede agreements in the other layers. It is documented in the Constitution (this document.)
2. The Collective layer prescribes _what should happen_. It includes agreements such as policies, schedules and best-practices which support and supercede agreements in the Operational layer. It is documented in the [Collective Choices](https://github.com/DougInAMug/projects/blob/master/baseNode_docColl.md).
3. The Operational layer describes _what actually happens_. This includes things such as norms, working-group agreements and spontaneous activity. It is not centrally documented.

## 2. Purposes
1. To provide public goods and services to the local community.
1. To provide and federate public and common-pool resources.
1. To develop and distribute of open-source software.
1. To generally decouple existence from preference.
1. To generally have a jolly good time.

## 3. Principles
1. Autonomy—minimize coercion.
1. Equality—minimize inequality.
1. Acceptability—minimize opposition.
1. Other guiding principles include those adopted by nature-inspired design such as [Permaculture](http://www.holmgren.com.au/downloads/Essence_of_Pc_EN.pdf), those contained within iterative development frameworks such as [Scrum](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) and those illustrated by [long-enduring Common Pool Resource institutions](https://github.com/DougInAMug/projects/blob/master/xOstromPrinciples.md).

<p align="center"><i>Procedures</i></p>

## 7. Application Procedure
1. Firstly, `the participants` should take a mock-vote in which they anonymously express whether they ‘support’, ‘accept’ or ‘oppose' the application succeeding. <!-- A mock-vote is used to encourage independent thought and counteract [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) during the subsequent discussion. The vote is done anonymously to counteract [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) and [peer pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure) from deterring people to express their honest opinion. -->
1. Secondly, `the participants` should discuss the application and, in particular, raise and address any concerns.
1. Finally, `the participants` should take a binding vote in the same fashion as the mock-vote. This time—
	1. if there are 3 or more times as many ‘support’ votes to ‘oppose’ votes, the application succeeds, or
	1. else the application fails at that time.
	
## 8. Operational Activity
### 8a. Autonomous Action
1. Any individual may take action provided that—
	1. they are unaware of any opposition towards the action, and
	1. they are willing and able to personally reverse the action if required.
1. There is no specific format for Individual Action. Whilst in some cases it may be appropriate for the individual to simply [start](https://blog.holacracy.org/individual-action-in-holacracy-6672a347238e), in other cases it may be more appropriate to first [ask for advice](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making) or [announce their proposal](https://medium.com/embassy-network/an-evolving-doocracy-3a6123f9b170) before starting.
1. Any individual that has opposition towards a current or proposed Individual Action should voice it early, clearly and kindly.
1. If a current or proposed Autonomous Action receives opposition it should be paused or postponed and the individuals involved should proceed with Unanimous Acceptance.
	
### 8b. Unanimous Acceptance
1. Unanimous Acceptance towards a proposal or action is attained whilst no involved individual opposes it.
1. There is no specific format for attaining Unanimous Acceptance. Many tools and techniques exist which may help, including: smaller-scale testing, presentation (with debate) and holding meetings with [planned agendas](http://cultivate.coop/wiki/Agenda_Planning), rounds, [talking objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_stick), [hand-signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement_hand_signals), [speaker-lists](http://cultivate.coop/wiki/Taking_Stack_(Meeting_Facilitation_Technique)) or time-limits.
1. If Unanimous Acceptance can not be attained in a proportionate time-frame, the individuals involved should procede with Score Voting. The switch from Unanimous Acceptance to Score Voting should be made by Unanimous Acceptance but may be made by simple majority.

### 8c. Score Voting
1. Firstly, individuals should discuss the current state-of-affairs, the initial proposal (if applicable) and generate alternative proposal(s). Afterwards, a list of proposals is created by gathering—
	1. the initial proposal and/or the generated proposals,
	1. a 'status quo' control proposal (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing',) and 
	1. an 'escalate procedure' control proposal (i.e. 'switch to Collective Change'.)
1. Secondly, the individuals should score the proposals as 'support’, ‘accept’ or ‘oppose'. Afterwards the scores for each proposal are totalled by counting 'support' as 1, 'accept' as 0 and 'oppose' as -3: the proposal with the highest total is selected. <!-- The differential weighting  between 'support' and 'oppose' has the philosophical basis of it being more preferable to avoid suffering than increase happiness and the procedural basis of monitoring and sanctioning accounting for significant cost. -->

## 9. Collective Change
1. Collective Change refers to the procedure by which any addition, subtraction or other change to the Collective Choices must be made.
1. The procedure is initiated when all in-space Members and Volunteers have been notified of a clear and explicit proposal from a Member or Volunteer which—
	1. has the support of at least 1 other Member or Volunteer, and
	1. is not contrary to any other Collective Change made within the last 7 days.
1. The primary phase of the procedure, lasts 3 days during which Members should consider the initial proposal and may create alternative proposals. At the end of the primary phase a list of proposals is created by gathering—
	1. the initial proposal and/or the generated proposals,
	1. a 'status quo' control proposal (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing',) and 
	1. an 'escalate procedure' control proposal (i.e. 'switch to Constitutional Change'.)
1. The secondary phase of the procedure lasts 3 days during which Members should individually score the listed proposals from a range of +3 (indicating total support) to -3 (indicating total opposition.) For a score to be valid it must identify the scorer. At the end of the secondary phase—
	1. negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 (e.g. a score of -2 becomes -6,)
	1. the adjusted scores for each proposal are totalled,
	1. the proposal with the highest total is selected, and 
	1. the Collective Choices should be changes to reflect this decision.

## 10. Constitutional Change
1. Constitutional Change refers to the procedure by which any addition, subtraction or other change to the Constitution must be made.
1. The procedure is initiated when all Members, both resident and remote, are notified of a clear and explicit proposal from a Member which—
	1. has the support of at least 2 other Members, and
	1. is not contrary to any other Constitutional Change made within the last 28 days.
1. The primary phase of the procedure lasts 7 days during which Members should consider the initial proposal and may create alternative proposals. At the end of the primary phase a list of proposals is created by gathering—
	1. the initial proposal and/or the generated proposals, and 
	1. a 'status quo' control proposal (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing'.)
1. The secondary phase of the procedure lasts 7 days during which Members should individually score the listed proposals from a range of +3 (indicating total support) to -3 (indicating total opposition.) For a score to be valid it must identify the scorer. At the end of the secondary phase—
	1. negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 (e.g. a score of -2 becomes -6,)
	1. the adjusted scores for each proposal are totalled,  
	1. the proposal with the highest total is selected, and
	1. if the selected proposal was also selected at the previous secondary phase—
		1. the proposal becomes the final decision, 
		1. the Constitution should be amended to reflect this decision, and
		1. the procedure of Constitutional Change is terminated. Or 
	1. else—
		1. the procedure is repeated (i.e. a further primary then secondary phase.)

## 11. Conflict Resolution
### 11a. Direct
1. Individuals are generally encouraged to resolve their conflicts directly.
1. There is no specific format for Direct Conflict Resolution. Many techniques and tools exist to prevent potential conflicts, manage ongoing conflicts and analyze resolved conflicts, including: the [Advice Process](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making), [Non-violent Communication](http://baynvc.org/key-assumptions-and-intentions-of-nvc/), [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/), [Sharing Circles](url), [1-on-1 dialogue](url), [Listen Looping, I-messages and Non-defensive Assertions.](https://loomio.coop/conflict_resolution_resources.html)

### 11b. Voluntary Assistance
1. If reasonable measures to resolve a conflict directly prove unsuccessful, individuals involved in a conflict (herein 'conflictant') may voluntarily seek and/or accept assistance from third-parties.
1. There is no specific format for Conflict Resolution with Voluntary Assistance. On the basis that all involved consent to participate, many scenarios are possible, including—
	1. a third-party individual supporting a single conflictant ('support person',)
	1. a third-party individual supporting multiple conflictants ('direct bridge',)
	1. support persons engaging in dialogue on behalf of the conflictants ('indirect bridge',) or
	1. a group of third-party individuals attend a meeting of the conflictants to bear witness and/or offer advice ('panel'.)

### 11c. Intervention
1. If reasonable measures to resolve a conflict with Voluntary Assistance prove unsuccessful, the Members may intervene as a last resort.
1. Conflict Resolution by Intervention is decided by Members in the absence of the conflictants by Unanimous Acceptance (8b.) or Score Voting (8c.) where proposals may include—
	1. requesting an individual to participate in assisted conflict resolution,
	1. revoking an individuals' position of Volunteer or Member, or
	1. instructing an individual to leave the space temporarily or indefinitely.
