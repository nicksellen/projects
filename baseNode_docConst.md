# The Constitution

## 1. Preamble
`NAME` is an open-entry, common-space. It is governed in three, cascading layers: the Constitutional layer, the Collective-Choice layer and the Operational layer. 

Constitutional layer is about to _how to decide what should happen_.
Collective-choice layer is about _decisions on what should happen_.
Operational layer is about _what actually happens_.

The Constitutional layer contains the core agreements upon which the other layers are built. It is documented in the Constitution (this document) and outlines the roles people can adopt and how changes can be made at the different layers.

The Collective-Choice layer contains more practical and specific agreements than those at the Constitutional layer. It is documented in the [Collective-Choices](https://github.com/DougInAMug/projects/blob/master/baseNode_docColl.md) and could include things such as policies, schedules, facts or best-practices.

The Operational layer describes everything else. It is not centrally documented and could include things such as sub-group agreements, informal agreements or norms.

<p align="center"><i>Procedures</i></p>

## 7. Application Procedure
1. Firstly, `the participants` should take a mock-vote in which they anonymously express whether they ‘support’, ‘accept’ or ‘oppose' the application succeeding. <!-- A mock-vote is used to encourage independent thought and counteract [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) during the subsequent discussion. The vote is done anonymously to counteract [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) and [peer pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure) from deterring people to express their honest opinion. -->
1. Secondly, `the participants` should discuss the application and, in particular, raise and address any concerns.
1. Finally, `the participants` should take a binding vote in the same fashion as the mock-vote. This time—
	1. if there are 3 or more times as many ‘support’ votes to ‘oppose’ votes, the application succeeds, or
	1. else the application fails at that time.
	
## 8. Operational Activity
### 8a. Individual Action
1. Any individual may take action by themself provided that—
	1. they are unaware of any opposition towards the action, and
	1. they are willing and able to personally reverse the action if required.
1. There is no specific format for Individual Action. Whilst in some cases it may be appropriate for the individual (herein 'actor') to simply [start](https://blog.holacracy.org/individual-action-in-holacracy-6672a347238e), in other cases it may be appropriate to first [ask for advice](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making) or [announce their plan](https://medium.com/embassy-network/an-evolving-doocracy-3a6123f9b170) before starting.
1. Any individual that has opposition towards a current or planned Individual Action may voice it and should do so early, clearly and kindly to the actor.
1. If a current or planned Individual Action receives opposition, the actor should pause or postpone it and proceed with Unanimous Acceptance.
	
### 8b. Unanimous Acceptance
1. Unanimous Acceptance of an action or proposal is attained if/when no involved individual opposes it after having a free, equal and unambiguous opportunity to do so.
1. There is no specific format for attaining Unanimous Acceptance. Many tools and techniques exist which may help, including: go-rounds, talking objects, consensus facilitation, socratic dialogue, dialectics, etc, etc.
1. If Unanimous Acceptance can not be attained in a proportionate time-frame, the involved individuals should procede with Score Voting. This switch from Unanimous Acceptance to Score Voting can itself be made by Unanimous Acceptance or by simple majority.

### 8c. Score Voting
1. Individuals should discuss to establish the current situation and generate alternative proposal(s). To be included alongside the generated proposals are—
	1. a 'status quo' control proposal (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing',) and 
	1. an 'escalate procedure' control proposal (i.e. 'switch to Collective Choice'.)
1. Individuals should score the proposals as 'support’, ‘accept’ or ‘oppose', then—
 	1. count 'support' as +1, 'accept' as 0 and 'oppose' as -3,
	1. total the adjusted scores for each proposal, and
	1. select the proposal with the highest total.

## 9. Collective Choice
1. Collective Choice refers to the procedure by which any addition, subtraction or other change to the Collective Choices must be made.
1. The procedure is initiated when all in-space Members and Volunteers have been notified of a clear and explicit proposal which is not contrary to any other Collective Choice made within the last 7 days.
1. The primary phase of the procedure, lasts 3 days during which Members should consider the initial proposal and may create alternative proposals. At the end of the primary phase a list of proposals is created by gathering—
	1. the initial proposal and/or the generated proposals,
	1. a 'status quo' control proposal (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing',) and 
	1. an 'escalate procedure' control proposal (i.e. 'switch to Constitutional Amendment'.)
1. The secondary phase of the procedure lasts 3 days during which Members should individually score the listed proposals from a range of +3 (indicating total support) to -3 (indicating total opposition.) For a score to be valid it must identify the scorer. At the end of the secondary phase—
	1. negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 (e.g. a score of -2 becomes -6,)
	1. the adjusted scores for each proposal are totalled,
	1. the proposal with the highest total is selected, and 
	1. the Collective Choices should be changes to reflect this decision.

## 10. Constitutional Amendment
1. Constitutional Amendment refers to the procedure by which any addition, subtraction or other change to the Constitution must be made.
1. The procedure is initiated when all Members, both resident and remote, are notified of a clear and explicit proposal which—
	1. has the support of at least 3 Members, and
	1. is not contrary to any other Constitutional Amendment made within the last 28 days.
1. The primary phase of the procedure lasts 7 days during which Members should consider the initial proposal and may create alternative proposals. At the end of the primary phase a list of proposals is created by gathering—
	1. the initial proposal and/or the generated proposals, and 
	1. a 'status quo' control proposal (i.e. 'keep things as they are/change nothing'.)
1. The secondary phase of the procedure lasts 7 days during which Members should individually score the listed proposals from a range of +3 (indicating total support) to -3 (indicating total opposition.) For a score to be valid it must identify the scorer. At the end of the secondary phase—
	1. negative scores are multiplied by a factor of 3 (e.g. a score of -2 becomes -6,)
	1. the adjusted scores for each proposal are totalled,  
	1. the proposal with the highest total is selected, and
	1. if the selected proposal was also selected at the previous secondary phase—
		1. the proposal becomes the final decision, 
		1. the Constitution should be amended to reflect this decision, and
		1. the procedure of Constitutional Amendment is terminated. Or 
	1. else—
		1. the procedure is repeated (i.e. a further primary then secondary phase.)

## 11. Conflict Resolution
### 11a. Direct
1. Individuals are generally encouraged to resolve their conflicts directly.
1. There is no specific format for Direct Conflict Resolution. Many techniques and tools exist to prevent potential conflicts, manage ongoing conflicts and analyze resolved conflicts, including: the [Advice Process](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making), [Non-violent Communication](http://baynvc.org/key-assumptions-and-intentions-of-nvc/), [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/), [Sharing Circles](url), [1-on-1 dialogue](url), [Listen Looping, I-messages and Non-defensive Assertions.](https://loomio.coop/conflict_resolution_resources.html)

### 11b. Voluntary Assistance
1. If reasonable measures to resolve a conflict directly prove unsuccessful, individuals involved in a conflict (herein 'conflictant') may voluntarily seek and/or accept assistance from third-parties.
1. There is no specific format for Conflict Resolution with Voluntary Assistance. On the basis that all involved consent to participate, many scenarios are possible, including—
	1. a third-party individual supporting a single conflictant ('support person',)
	1. a third-party individual supporting multiple conflictants ('direct bridge',)
	1. support persons engaging in dialogue on behalf of the conflictants ('indirect bridge',) or
	1. a group of third-party individuals attend a meeting of the conflictants to bear witness and/or offer advice ('panel'.)

### 11c. Intervention
1. If reasonable measures to resolve a conflict with Voluntary Assistance prove unsuccessful, the Members may intervene as a last resort.
1. Conflict Resolution by Intervention is done using the Score Voting procedure, where proposals may include—
	1. requesting an individual to participate in assisted conflict resolution,
	1. revoking an individuals' position of Volunteer or Member, or
	1. requesting an individual to leave the space temporarily or indefinitely.

NOT FINISHED
- preamble, purposes and responsibilities.
- principles, may do well with a bit of rejigging
- positions
	- do they need descriptions?
	- should 'assuming responsibilities' be a criterion?
	- should 'continuous stay' be a criterion?
- include comment about negative weighted score voting
- layer names... specificially collective layer.
