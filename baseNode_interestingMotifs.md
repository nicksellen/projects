`mustLeaveAfter(periodOfTime)`  
(Fuenza?) is a squat where almost anyone can come and stay as a guest. However, all guests must leave after one week, including guests who get on super well with the community. This is a very clear rule which allows both the community and the guest time to reflect on their experience. It also dislodges and deters those who fit badly from remaining simply because it's easy.

`requestedToLeave()`  
[Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/) is a non-residential hackerspace in San Francisco. To prevent the escalation of conflict individuals must, if requested, [leave the space](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Community_Standards#Requests_to_Leave) whether or not they believe it is justified. Those who have been asked to leave may come to the next weekly meeting to resolve the issue, but not before then. This is a very clear rule and whilst someone could abuse this rule, the likelihood of it back-firing seems sufficiently high to prevent this.

`probationaryMembership(periodOfTime)`  
Lebenstraumgemeinschaft is a living community in Janihausen where about 50 people stay. Those wishing to become members become probationary members for a whole year. During this time they are requested to attend certain meetings (including ones for coordination and conflict resolution) and do not directly participate in core decisions. After one year there is a decision by the existing members on whether to grant full membership. Very clear and gives a lot of time to see whether a new person fits.
