`mustLeaveAfter(periodOfTime)`
Fuenza is a squat where almost anyone can come and stay as a guest. However, all guests must leave after one week including guests who get on super well with the community. This is a very clear rule which allows both the community and guest time to reflect on their experience. It also dislodges and deters those who fit badly from remaining simply because it's easy.

`askedToLeave()`
Noisebridge is a hackerspace in San Francisco where people can use the space and resources for technological pursuits: it cannot be used a residential space. Individuals must, if asked, leave the space. Those who have been asked may come to the next weekly meeting to appeal, but not before then. This is a very clear rule which is aimed to prevent serious conflicts from escalating further. Whilst someone could abuse this rule, the likelihood of back-firing seems sufficiently high to prevent this.

`probationaryMembershipFor(periodOfTime)`
Janishausen is a living community in xxx where about 50 people stay. Those wishing to become members become probationary members for a whole year. During this time they are requested to attend certain meetings (including ones for coordination and conflict resolution) and do not directly participate in core decisions. After one year there is a decision by the existing members on whether to grant full membership. Very clear and gives a lot of time to see whether a new person fits.
