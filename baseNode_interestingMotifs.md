# Interesting motifs
This is a collection of interesting governance patterns and procedure from other residential projects.

`mustLeaveAfter(periodOfTime)`  
Benecommuna is a squat in Firenze where almost anyone can come and stay as a guest. However, all guests must leave after one week, including guests who get on super well with the community. This is a very clear rule which allows both the community and the guest time to reflect on their experience. It also dislodges and deters those who fit badly from remaining simply because it's easy.

`requestToLeave()`  
[Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/) is a non-residential hackerspace in San Francisco. To prevent the escalation of conflict individuals must, if requested, [leave the space](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Community_Standards#Requests_to_Leave) whether or not they believe it is justified. Those who have been asked to leave may come to the next weekly meeting to resolve the issue, but not before then. This is a very clear rule and whilst someone could abuse this rule, the likelihood of it back-firing seems sufficiently high to prevent this.

`probationaryMembership(periodOfTime)`  
Lebenstraumgemeinschaft is an intentional community in Janihausen where about 50 people stay. Those wishing to become members become probationary members for a whole year. During this time they are requested to attend certain meetings (including ones for coordination and conflict resolution) and do not directly participate in core decisions. After one year there is a decision by the existing members on whether to grant full membership. Very clear and gives a lot of time to see whether a new person fits.

`communityHibernation(regularPeriodOfTime)`  
Tamera is an intentional community in Portugal for several hundred people. Every winter they minimize new arrivals and reevaluate their way of doing things. This seasonal variation brings annual rhythym into the community and allows for deep and uninterupted reevaluation.

`cleaningParty(regularPeriodOfTime)`  
Liebemenschhaus is/was an intentional community in Mainz where about 10 people stay. In addition to regular cleaning norms, all deep cleaning is done by everyone for one hour starting at 06:00 every Thursday - the only time everyone could manage. Clear, everyone working together makes it more fun, shows that everyone is doing something for the house and easily incorporates new arrivals compared to a rota.
