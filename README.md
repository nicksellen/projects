# projects

Me trying to use plain text to organize my projects in terms of
* _Name_ // Short-hand project name.
* _Description_ // Short, high-level description of the project.
* _Features_ // Some lower-level details of the project.
* _Deliverables_ // Testable measures if a project is intangible (i.e. learning JavaScript.)
* _Requirements_ // Exceptional resources needed for this project to progress*.

General resources I need for mid/long-term project work include: 
* drinkable water 'on tap'.
* low/no-cost food. (E.g. dumpster-diving, foodshating, bulk-buying, gleaning, foraging, etc.)
* a relatively calm space which is 18 - 25 C with internet speed of 2+ Mbit/s.
* a bathing facility with 25+ C running water.
* a sleeping space of at least moderate comfort which I can reliably (90 %) use without disturbing others/being disturbed.
* at least one other person I generally get along with and who is working in a similar direction.
* access to general maintenance tools and supplies. (e.g. screw-drivers, pliers, duct tape, etc.)
* a functional bike.
* a washing machine. 
* a printer.
* Etc.
