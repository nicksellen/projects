# projects

Me trying to use plain text to organize my projects:

* _Name_ // Short-hand project name.
* _Description_ // Short, high-level description of the project.
* _Features_ // Some lower-level details of the project.
* _Deliverables_ // Testable measures if a project is intangible (i.e. learning JavaScript.)
* _Requirements_ // Exceptional resources needed for this project to progress*.

*General resources I need for mid/long-term project work IBNLT: 
* Direct connection to drinkable water.
* Low-cost access to food (dumpster dived, donated, bulk-buy, gleaning, foraging, etc.)
* Space between 18 - 25 C with internet connection 2+ Mbit/s.
* Bathing facility with 25+ C water.
* Sleeping facility of moderate+ comfort which I can use without disturbing/being disturbed.
* At least one other person who smiles daily and is working in a similar direction.
* Maintenance tools. (e.g. screw drivers, pliers, etc)
* Functional bike.
* Washing machine. (Having a printer is also super good.)
