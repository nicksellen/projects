> I like to split my time between times of intensity and times of serenity. Intensity is what I aim for when I go to events, gatherings, etc. Serenity is what the HQ is for
>
> Therefor, the features of the ideal HQ are:
> - I can let most of my stuffs there and know it will still be there when I come back a few weeks later, with a vague filling that "that's my place"
> - I can sit at a good desk with good connectivity and do the amount of work I want to do, without being disturbed, not talking to anyone for a few hours, and not being blamed for it
> - being social is opt-in: alone is the default. But being social is as easy as getting to the building's main room and start chatting, playing, having a few beers with the other people who are up for being social at that moment.
> - people around love to learn and are actively working on interesting projects, not just cuddling all day ;)
> - not to far from a city where I can meet more people interested in using and contributing to inventaire
> - have other unexpected but delicious features"
