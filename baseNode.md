Name: baseNode

Description: A space that I and others can use to work, play and _live_ to the fullest extent and enable others to do the same. An important implication therein is the decoupling of money and right and therefore removing the pay-walls of buying or renting.

Features:
* Common governance (see Ostroms ['Design principles illustrated by long-enduring CPR institutions'](http://www.smrfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009-Elinor-Ostrom-8-CPR-Design-Principles.png).)
* Institutional stability for planning and executing long-term projects.
* Rent-free (i.e. financial matters dealt with as a project, not as individuals. 'Rent-free' does not mean no financial provisions.)
* Uncompromizing legal status (e.g. not squatted nor without residential license.)
* A spectrum of open to closed spaces.
* Balance between carrying capacity and flexibility. (e.g. possible to leave for a week with assurance you can return, but not possible that the building is abandoned for 9 months.)

Requirements:
* Coherent and sufficiently detailed concept.
* A legal association conducive to common governance.
* The rights to a suitable building.
* Finance for capital and operational expediture.

Tasks:
* Skeletal constitutional rule set. (const: who, how, what. coll: how, what. op: what.
